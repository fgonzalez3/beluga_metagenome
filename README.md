# Beluga Metagenome
This repo contains documentation for Beluga whale metagenome assembly. 

Initial metagenomics QC and assembly can be found [here](https://github.com/fgonzalez3/beluga_metagenome/blob/main/workflow.md). The initial SeqCenter data showed hits to Morbillivirus, which is something we're interested in for this project. However, this was shotgun DNA data so that shouldn't have happened. I wrote some quick code to sort this out [here](https://github.com/fgonzalez3/beluga_metagenome/blob/main/Morbillivirus.md). 

This pipeline broadly followed that laid out [here](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/metagenomics-analysis/).
